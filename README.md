# In early development stage

# FRSGUI 
Framework for Rapid and Simple development of General User Interface applications, based on SFML


# Objectives

Task priority: 
  - Rebuilding the style system to <unordered_map> with <variant> instead of variables on top of variables (making the system scalable and easy to add new styles)
  - ~~CHANGE THE PASSES BY CONST REFERENCE TO PASS BY VALUE WHEN USING SIMPLE DATATYPES YOU DONKEY!!!!! (ref/ptr = 8 bytes, uint32 = 4bytes nice brain nice)~~
  - ~~Custom UI_elements~~
  - Create hard-coded UI_elements: 
      - ~~Button~~
      - Input: 
          - Textarea 
          - Number inputs 
      - Slider 
  - ~~Custom styling to these new elements~~
  - ~~Custom handler functions for elements~~ 

   - ~~Refactor rendering~~
   - Code optimalization

  - Future, shallow ideas:
    - Dynamic interaction with elements? (drag and drop, resize by mouse)
